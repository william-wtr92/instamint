# ðŸŽ¨ Custom UI-Kit

ðŸ’¡At **Instamint**, we use our own `UI-Kit`, which allows us to externalize our reusable components across all our
projects, thereby ensuring greater flexibility.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To install the `UI-Kit`, you can use the following command:

```bash
pnpm i @instamint/ui-kit
```

## ðŸ“š Usage

To use the `UI-Kit` in your project, you can import the components from the package and use them in your code.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@instamint/ui-kit"

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

ðŸš€ UI-Kit is build with `TypeScript`, `TailwindCSS` & `Zod`.
