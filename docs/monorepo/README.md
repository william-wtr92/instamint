# üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨ Architecture of the monorepo

- The monorepo is a _**single repository that contains multiple projects**_.
- It is a way to organize your codebase and _**manage your dependencies**_. It is a good fit for large projects with
  multiple teams working on different parts of the codebase.

## ‚ùì Why use a monorepo

- **_Code sharing_**: It allows you to share code between projects. This can be useful for sharing common libraries,
  components, or utilities.
- **_Dependency management_**: It allows you to manage your dependencies in a single place. This can make it easier to
  keep your dependencies up to date and avoid version conflicts.
- **_Consistent tooling_**: It allows you to use consistent tooling across all your projects. This can make it easier to
  set up and maintain your development environment.
- **_Simplified build process_**: It allows you to build and test your projects together. This can make it easier to
  ensure that your projects work well together.

## üì¶ Structure of the monorepo

- `/root/`: The root of the monorepo contains the **_configuration files, Docker Compose, scripts_** that are used to
  manage the monorepo.

- `/apps/client & /apps/server `: This directories contains the **_applications_** that are part of the monorepo. Each
  application is a separate
  project with its own **_source code, dependencies, and build process_**.

- `/packages`: This directory contains the **_shared packages_** that are used by the applications. These packages can
  be
  shared between the applications and can contain **_shared code, components, or utilities_**.

- `/docker`: This directory contains the **_Dockerfiles_** for the applications and shared packages. These Dockerfiles
  are
  used to build the **_Docker images_** for the applications and shared packages.

- `/.github`: This directory contains the **_GitHub Actions_** workflows, **_pull request templates_**, and other GitHub
  related files.

- `/bruno`: Bruno API Client with the collections directly in a folder on your filesystem.

- `/docs`: This directory contains the **_documentation_** for the monorepo. This can include \*\*\_process documentation,
  code

- `/sprints-reports`: This directory include **_sprint planning, sprint review, sprint retrospective_**.

## üï∏Ô∏è Architecture

- In this monorepo, we use a **_microservices architecture_** for the server side. This means that each application is a
  separate service that is responsible for a specific part of the system.
- This can make it easier to develop, test, and deploy the applications independently.
